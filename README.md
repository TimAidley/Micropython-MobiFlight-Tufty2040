# Micropython-MobiFlight-Tufty2040
This is a limited implementation of the Mobiflight firmware written in Micropython on the Tufty2040 hardware.

The intention is to run things like attitude indicators, com radios etc directly on the Tufty2040 without modification.

The current state is little more than a proof-of-concept, and very *very* early in development.
